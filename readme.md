# Print a given matrix in spiral form

## Submited answer and implementation by: Nick Gatti

### This code project is a visual answer to illustrate how I was able to solve a matrix problem where you are asked to print the numbers within a matrix in a spiral form.

#### An example input would be:
```
[ 
[1, 2, 3], 
[4, 5, 6], 
[7, 8, 9], 
]; 
```
#### The expected output for this would be:
```
[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]; 
```

* **Output in 3 forms; the answer, the non-mutated original matrix and html pushed back with PHP and solved by Javascript**
* **Exercise taken from my teachers at school (commonly asked interview question)**
* **Form submission sends matrix length to PHP backend which builds the matrix in html form and sends it back where javascript takes care of the rest**
